            <div><br>Durban based ladieswear designer, Pinky Dlamini is the owner and creative director of brand Modesta</br> 
              <br> which is known for its elegant, timeless and contemporary style that perfectly suits</br> today’s busy women.

                Dlamini was inspired to join the fashion industry when she became fascinated with 
                the process of taking</br><br> an idea and bringing it to life in the form of sketch before
                 translating it into a completed garment through the use of the fabric, trimmings and technical skill.</br>
                
                
            </div></br>She obtained a National Diploma in Fashion obtained from Durban University of Technology (DUT).
             As her designs continue to mature,<br> she remains inspired by South Africa’s diverse cultures and traditions,
              different tribes, lifestyles and everyday life.</br>
            <br> which help provide the colourful, afrocentric palette that is evident in her collections</br>

                 network and make contacts.</br> Most importantly we get to see and learn what other brands in our own sector and businesses 
                 in other sectors do and how we can improve our work as a whole.
